# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

In this project the user guesses a letter in the input against a word chosen by the computer from our list of given words.
The user starts with 5 lives and each guess which doesnt match a letter in the word reduces the lives by one.

I learned how to call upon multiple functions in a project as well as the use of classes.
